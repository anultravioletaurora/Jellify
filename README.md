### ‚ÑπÔ∏è About

> **jellify** (verb) - _to make gelatinous_ <br>
> [see also](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/jellify)

_Jellify_ is a free and open source music player for [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/). Built with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/), _Jellify_ provides a user experience that feels familar to other popular music apps and a has featureset to match

> _Jellify_ requires a connection to a [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/) server to work.

### ü§ì Background

I was after a music app for Jellyfin that showcased my music with artwork, had a user interface congruent with what the big guys do, and had the ability to algorithmically curate music (not that you have to use _Jellify_ that way). I also wanted to create a music app that could handle my extremely large music libraries (i.e., 100K+ songs) and not get bogged down.

This app was designed with me and my dad in mind, since I wanted to give him a sleek, one stop shop for live recordings of bands he likes (read: the Grateful Dead). The UI was designed so that he'd find it instantly familiar and useful. CarPlay / Android Auto support was also a must for us, as we both use CarPlay religiously.

**TL;DR** Designed to be lightweight and scalable, _Jellify_ caters to those who want a mobile Jellyfin music experience similar to what's provided by the big music streaming services.

### üíú Love from Wisconsin üßÄ

This is undoubtedly a passion project of [mine](https://github.com/anultravioletaurora), and I've learned a lot from working on it (and the many failed attempts before it). I hope you enjoy using it! Feature requests and bug reports are welcome :)

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èRunning Locally

### ‚öõÔ∏è Universal Dependencies

-   [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) for Fastlane
-   [NodeJS v22](https://nodejs.org/en/download) for React Native

### üçé iOS

#### Dependencies

-   [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) for building

#### Instructions

##### Setup

-   Clone this repository
-   Run `yarn init:ios` to initialize the project
    -   This will install `npm` packages, install `bundler` and required gems, and install required CocoaPods
-   In the `ios` directory, run `fastlane match development --readonly` to fetch the development signing certificates
    -   *You will need access to the *Jellify Signing* private repository*

##### Running

-   Run `yarn start` to start the dev server
-   Open the `Jellify.xcodeworkspace` with Xcode, _not_ the `Jellify.xcodeproject`
-   Run either on a device or in the simulator
    -   _You will need to wait for Xcode to finish it's "Indexing" step_

##### Building

-   To create a build, run `yarn fastlane:ios:build` to use fastlane to compile an `.ipa`

### ü§ñ Android
